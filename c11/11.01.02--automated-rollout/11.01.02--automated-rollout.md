The following command tells Docker to change the `hello-world` service to
 use the image tagged `v2`. It further qualifies the deployment characteristics:

- only one replica should be updated at a time;
- wait for 30 seconds between updating each batch of replicas;
- each replica should be stopped before its replacement is started.

```
docker service update \
--image dockerinaction/ch11_service_hw:v2 \
--update-order stop-first \
--update-parallelism 1 \
--update-delay 30s \
hello-world
```

We use parallelism to balance the time it takes to update our service with
protection for our users from failed transitions.

We introduce
 delay between update batches to allow new service instances to
 become stable before starting (and to make sure that the underlying
 platform remains stable). In reality, 30 seconds might not be
 enough time. It depends on the application.


```
$ docker service update \
> --image dockerinaction/ch11_service_hw:v2 \
> --update-order stop-first \
> --update-parallelism 1 \
> --update-delay 30s \
> hello-world
hello-world
overall progress: 0 out of 3 tasks
1/3: starting  [============================================>      ]
2/3:
3/3:
```

If everything goes well, it will close by stating that the **Service converged**.
That is a particularly robotic way of telling the user that the **command was successful**.

```
1/3: running   [==================================================>]
2/3: running   [==================================================>]
3/3: running   [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

**Converged** is a technical way to say that current state of
 the service is the same as the desired state described by the command.

You should be able to reload the application in your browser and see that it has been signed `--ServiceV2`:

```
$ curl -i localhost:8080
