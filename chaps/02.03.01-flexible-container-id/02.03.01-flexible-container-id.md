## 2.3.1 Flexible container identification

### Saving the id in shell variables

(Page 30)

```
% CID=$(docker create nginx:latest)
% echo $CID
9b1c1b78b1e46ff22d124e6098a86a2c39248a92df37b6003f2e997bb2a5b626
```

Although saving the id in shell variables this is a better solution for identifying container, name conflict can still happen; however, the scope is limited to the terminal session or current processing environment in which the script was launched. 

**Tips**

(page 31) If you have created the container but forget to capture the container id in the variable, you can use `--latest` (`-l`) flag in the `docker ps` coammand to generate the most recent id. 

```
CID=$(docker ps -l -q)
```
If you want the full container's id add the flag `--no-trunc`.

 
###  Container ID file (.CID)


The danger of shell variable is it is lost once the shell is terminated. To get around this we use container ID file (*.cid), provide by the `--cidfile` flag.


```
% docker create --cidfile ~/tmp/my-web.cid nginx
fc3a7dcbb14.....02bfef5c0b5

% cat ~/tmp/my-web.cid
fc3a7dcbb14.....02bfef5c0b5%
```

The cidfile is better than shell varibale b/c it is persisted even shell is terminal. 

And docker will refuse to create if the file exist, each cid file is associate to an instance for docker creation:

```
% docker create --cidfile ~/tmp/my-web.cid nginx
Container ID file found, make sure the other container isn't running or delete /Users/apollo.tang/tmp/my-web.cid
```

So you need a different name for each container. However, you can create container with the same filename in a different folder: 

```
% docker create --cidfile ~/Desktop/my-web.cid nginx
62f02c5039b48f0c6ec2530b957a7e9cb1a9300a14e6bb67553426d30f4b97e5
```

**Tips**

It is a good practice to stratigically partitioning namespace by the path/to/cidfile  to avoid file-naming collisions. For eg:

```
/container/web/customer1/web.cid
/container/web/customer2/web.cid
... etc 
```
