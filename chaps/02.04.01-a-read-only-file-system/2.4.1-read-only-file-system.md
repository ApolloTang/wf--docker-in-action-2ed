# 2.4.1 Read-only filesystems

```
docker run -d --name wp \
--read-only \ 
wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache

docker ps -l

```

Lets inspect to see if wp is running:

```
docker inspect --format "{{.State.Running}}" wp

false
```

it is not running, lets see the log for the reason it is not running:

```
docker logs wp

```

We got error: 

```
Fatal Error Unable to create lock file: Bad file descriptor
```

The is because it is a read-only filesystem. 

Lets try again, but this time we will not specify `read-only`, with name `wp_writeable`.

```
docker run -d --name wp_writable \
wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache

```

Lets see what has changed in the container's file system after running thie container:

```
docker container diff wp_writable
C /run
C /run/apache2
A /run/apache2/apache2.pid
```


## Lets run a Wordpress container as how it should be run

Lets do this again with the read-only filesystem. We will allow the container to write to `/run/apache2` by using a writable volume mounted from the host. 
We will also supply a temporary, in-memory, filesystem to the container at `/tmp` since Apache requires a writable temporary directory:

```
docker run -d --name wp2 \
--read-only \
-v /run/apache2/ \
--tmpfs /tmp \
wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache

```

| parameter | explanation | 
|-----------|-------------|
| `--read-only`      | Makes container’s root filesystem read-only  | 
| `-v /run/apache2/` | Mounts a writable directory from the host    |  
| `--tmpfs /tmp` | Provides container an in memory temp filesystem    |  


```
