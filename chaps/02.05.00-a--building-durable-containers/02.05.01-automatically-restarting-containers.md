# 2.5 Building durable containers

## Page 41

A Docker container can be in one of six states:

* Created 
* Running 
* Restarting 
* Paused 
* Removing 
* Exited (also used if the container has never been started)

---

# 2.5.1 Automatic restart (--restart)  

Use automatically restarting wisely: docker usually exit when the specified process completed, if you specify `--restart`, it will restart and exist in an infinite loop. 

Restarted after a predetermined time is called **Backof strategy**

**Exponential backof strategy**: restart time is double on each failure.

$ docker run -d --name backoff-detector --restart always busybox:1.29 date

$ docker logs -f backoff-detector

```

Containers waiting to be restarted are in the **restarting** state.
You can not access a restarting container. This could be a problem if you need use the `exec` command to run diagnostic:

```
docker exec backoff-detector echo 'Just a Test'
Error response from daemon: Container f52c0ac95ca....5cc03652a8d is restarting, wait until the container is running
```
