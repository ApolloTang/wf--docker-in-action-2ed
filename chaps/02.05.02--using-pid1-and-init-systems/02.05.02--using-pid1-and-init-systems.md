## 2.5.2 Using PID 1 and init systems

Page 42-43

The **init system** is a program that's used to launch and maintain the state of other programs.

In Docker the init pramgram is usually the process with PID 1.

The job of this init sytsm are, for example:
 * starts other processes,
 * resetrts them if they fail
 * commmunica with the operation system.

Example of the name of init system are:
 * runit,
 * Yelp/dumb-init,
 * tini
 * supervisord
 * tianon/gosu.

We will examine how **supervisord** restart a fail `apachi2` process in LAMP.

Lets run a LAMP container:

```
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name lamp-test tutum/lamp
3bf9cf77b3d02e4c67e02829d8628390d19afa9df994eb5d17b70a0eabea9510
```

To see the processess currently running inside this container, use `top`.
You can see the process `supervisord` is the first line.

```
$ docker top lamp-test
UID        PID    PPID   C  STIME  TTY TIME      CMD
root       19272  19244  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/supervisord -n
root       19731  19272  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe
root       19732  19272  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
www-data   19815  19732  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
www-data   19816  19732  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
www-data   19818  19732  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
www-data   19821  19732  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
www-data   19822  19732  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  apache2 -D FOREGROUND
_rpc       20095  19731  0  07:23  ?   00:00:00  /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin --user=mysql --log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --port=3306
```

Lets obtain the PID of `apache2`. And from the list below you can see it is `436`:

```
$ docker exec lamp-test ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:00 supervisord
  435 ?        00:00:00 mysqld_safe
  436 ?        00:00:00 apache2
  817 ?        00:00:00 ps
```

❓ Question to self: what is the different between the PID column in `top` command and `ps` command ?
notice that in PID for supervisord is 19272 in one case but 1 in the other. One thing for sure to kill a process
I should get the PID using `ps` instead of `top`.

Now that we have the PID for `apache2`, lets kill it:

```
docker exec lamp-test kill 436
```

Lets examine the log:

```
$ docker logs lamp-test

```

In the log entry `07:23:26,599` you can apach2 started for the
first time then existed in `07:25:00,871` and spawned again in ` 07:25:01,876`:

```

2021-11-05 07:23:26,599 INFO success: apache2 entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)

2021-11-05 07:25:02,917 INFO success: apache2 entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)```
```

Check with `ps` command again you can see `apache2` have a new PID: `830` (previously `436`):

```
$ docker exec lamp-test ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:00 supervisord
  435 ?        00:00:00 mysqld_safe
  830 ?        00:00:00 apache2
  837 ?        00:00:00 ps
```

Different container uses different strategy to manage the start up process. In the wordpress container for example has a custom script at:

```
/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
```

You can see this script with following:

```
docker run wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache cat /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh > docker-entrypoint.sh
```


## Entrypoint

Docker containers run `entrypoint` before executing commands.

This command (`entrypoint`) can be used to validates the preconditions of a container.

Will be discuss in PART 2

But here is a quick preview:

```
docker run --entrypoint="cat" \
wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh

```
In the above, `--entrypoint` flag to specify the program (`cat`) to run,
and the command section to pass the arguments (`/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh`) to cat.
In effect it is same as:

```
docker run wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache cat /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
```

## Regarding `docker-entrypoint.sh` -- the start up script for wordpress

It validates the environment variables against the dependencies
of the software and sets default values. Once the script has validated
that WordPress can execute, it will start the requested or default command.

## Warning! ⚠️

Running startup scripts as PID 1 is problematic when the script
 fails to meet the expectations that Linux has for init systems.
 Depending on your use case, you might find that one approach
 or a hybrid works best.
